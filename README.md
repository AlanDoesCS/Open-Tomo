# Open-Tomo 🏝️
A cozy life simulator inspired by *Tomodachi Life*, but using a language model to add more depth to interactions.

In game characters have evolving personalities, memory, emotions, and relationships, driven by a local large language model in a structured way. It's a weird little world where your digital friends actually remember what you say.
